        <h2>What is Goatbb?</h2>
        Goatbb is an easy to use open source forum, this means you can download and use it for free.<br><br>
        We use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> as layout framework so that you can easily change the layout
        to what you want without having to worry about making the layout responsive. For the BBCode editor we use <a href="http://summernote.org" target="_blank">Summernote</a>
        which is a bootstrap based WYSIWYG editor so that makes even the editor responsive and functional on phones and tablets.
